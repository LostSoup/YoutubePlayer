# YoutubePlayer

*Currently under devlopment*

This website uses youtube video codes to load a YouTube player. I envision this being used for music, as you can see in the currently hardcoded video codes, but this might be useful for any other videos that you don't want recommendations or other disctractions interrupting you. There is also a clock in both 24 hour and epoch time formats, because why not?

If you can think of any other names, I am open to suggestions.
